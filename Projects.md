- [Coursera Machine Learning Exercises](https://github.com/larusso94/Coursera-Machine-learning-exercises) - A series of exercises covering fundamental machine learning concepts, implemented in MATLAB, as part of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera.

- [Shark Species Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larusso94/shark-species) - This dataset, created from scratch using Google Image APIs, comprises images for shark species classification. It was cleaned with FastAI Python libraries and used in conjunction with a pre-trained ResNet model for the classification of various shark species.

- [Test the Sharks Classifier](https://github.com/larusso94/Sharks) - This GitHub repository contains a binder-enabled Jupyter Notebook that allows for the interactive testing of the shark species classification model. The model utilizes a pre-trained ResNet and is based on a dataset created using Google Image APIs and cleaned with FastAI Python libraries.

- [Whiplash-Disco on GitHub](https://github.com/larusso94/Whiplash-Disco) - This repository is part of a collaboration for the GameJam organized by GDG Tarragona. The project focuses on game development using Unity with scripting in C#. It showcases innovative game design and programming skills, reflecting the collaborative and creative aspects of participating in a game development challenge.

- [IBM Professional Certificate Data Science Capstone Course](https://github.com/larusso94/IBM-Proffessional-Certificate-Data-Science-Capstone-Course/tree/master) - Contains the detailed analysis of 911 call data for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project, showcasing in-depth exploratory and predictive data analysis techniques.

- [Labyrinth Pathfinder Project](https://github.com/larusso94/labirynth_damavis) - This project showcases a Python-based solution for pathfinding in a labyrinth. It employs object-oriented principles, utilizing custom classes for the rod and labyrinth, and implements a breadth-first search algorithm for efficient navigation. The project also emphasizes code quality and reliability through unit testing, demonstrating algorithmic efficiency and modularity.
