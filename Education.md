I pursued my [Bachelor's degree](#computer-science-bachelor-degree) in Computer Science from [Rovira i Virgili University](https://www.urv.cat/). During this time, I delved deep into the major Computer Science fundamentals. My dedication to the field was further demonstrated as I took on roles like a class representative and collaborated with initiatives like [URBots](https://www.urbots.org/) Robotics Association. Additionally, I had the privilege to engage with the GDG Tarragona community.

My academic journey also took me to the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology - NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) as an [Erasmus+ Experience](#erasmus-experience-computer-science-bachelor-degree) for a complete academic year in Computer Science Bachelors. This opportunity allowed me to specialize in areas like Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Recommendation Systems, Multivariate Data Analysis, Cloud Environments and Parallel Computing.

These experiences have given me a comprehensive foundation in the world of computer science and software engineering, setting the stage for my future endeavors in the tech industry.
